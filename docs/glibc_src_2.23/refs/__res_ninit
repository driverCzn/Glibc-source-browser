 * Set up default settings.  If the configuration file exist, the values
 * there will have precedence.  Otherwise, the server address is set to
 * INADDR_ANY and the default domain name comes from the gethostname().
 *
 * An interrim version of this code (BIND 4.9, pre-4.4BSD) used 127.0.0.1
 * rather than INADDR_ANY (&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;) as the default name server address
 * since it was noted that INADDR_ANY actually meant ``the first interface
 * you &quot;ifconfig&quot;&apos;d at boot time&apos;&apos; and if this was a SLIP or PPP interface,
 * it had to be &quot;up&quot; in order for you to reach your own name server.  It
 * was later decided that since the recommended practice is to always
 * install local static routes through 127.0.0.1 for all your network
 * interfaces, that we could solve this problem without a code change.
 *
 * The configuration file should always be used, since it is the only way
 * to specify a default domain.  If you are running a server on your local
 * machine, you should say &quot;nameserver 0.0.0.0&quot; or &quot;nameserver 127.0.0.1&quot;
 * in the configuration file.
 *
 * Return 0 if completes successfully, -1 on error
