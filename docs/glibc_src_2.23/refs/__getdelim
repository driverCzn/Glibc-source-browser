   NULL), pointing to *N characters of space.  It is realloc&apos;d as
   necessary.  Returns the number of characters read (not including the
   null terminator), or -1 on error or EOF.

   These functions are not part of POSIX and therefore no official

   or due to the implementation they are cancellation points and
   therefore not marked with __THROW.  */</doc>
