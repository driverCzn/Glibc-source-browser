 * The call rpc message, msg has been obtained from the wire.  The msg contains
 * the raw form of credentials and verifiers.  authenticate returns AUTH_OK
 * if the msg is successfully authenticated.  If AUTH_OK then the routine also
 * does the following things:
 * set rqst-&gt;rq_xprt-&gt;verf to the appropriate response verifier;
 * sets rqst-&gt;rq_client_cred to the &quot;cooked&quot; form of the credentials.
 *
 * NB: rqst-&gt;rq_cxprt-&gt;verf must be pre-allocated;
 * its length is set appropriately.
 *
 * The caller still owns and is responsible for msg-&gt;u.cmb.cred and
 * msg-&gt;u.cmb.verf.  The authentication system retains ownership of
 * rqst-&gt;rq_client_cred, the cooked credentials.
 *
 * There is an assumption that any flavour less than AUTH_NULL is
 * invalid.
