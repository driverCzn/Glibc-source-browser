   initialized with __libc_lock_init before it can be used (or define it
   with __libc_lock_define_initialized, below).  Use `extern&apos; for CLASS to
   declare a lock defined in another module.  In public structure
   definitions you must use a pointer to the lock structure (i.e., NAME
   begins with a `*&apos;), because its storage size will not be known outside
   of libc.  */</doc>
