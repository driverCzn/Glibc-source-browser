 * If no_new_privs is set, then operations that grant new privileges (i.e.
 * execve) will either fail or not grant them.  This affects suid/sgid,
 * file capabilities, and LSMs.
 *
 * Operations that merely manipulate or drop existing privileges (setresuid,
 * capset, etc.) will still work.  Drop those privileges if you want them gone.
 *
 * Changing LSM security domain is considered a new privilege.  So, for example,
 * asking selinux for a specific new context (e.g. with runcon) will result
 * in execve returning -EPERM.
 *
 * See Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt for more details.
