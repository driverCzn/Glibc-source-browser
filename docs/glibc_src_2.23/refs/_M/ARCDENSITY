 * Percent of text space to allocate for tostructs.
 * This is a heuristic; we will fail with a warning when profiling programs
 * with a very large number of very small functions, but that&apos;s
 * normally OK.
 * 2 is probably still a good value for normal programs.
 * Profiling a test case with 64000 small functions will work if
 * you raise this value to 3 and link statically (which bloats the
 * text size, thus raising the number of arcs expected by the heuristic).
