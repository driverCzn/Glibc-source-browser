   actual option parser), but rather an arbitrary piece of documentation that
   should be displayed in much the same manner as the options.  If this flag
   is set, then the option NAME field is displayed unmodified (e.g., no `--&apos;
   prefix is added) at the left-margin (where a *short* option would normally
   be displayed), and the documentation string in the normal place.  For
   purposes of sorting, any leading whitespace and punctuation is ignored,
   except that if the first non-whitespace character is not `-&apos;, this entry
   is displayed after all options (and OPTION_DOC entries with a leading `-&apos;)
   in the same group.  */</doc>
