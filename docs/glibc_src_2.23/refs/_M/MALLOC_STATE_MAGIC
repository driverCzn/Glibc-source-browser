<doc f='glibc_src_2.23/malloc/hooks.c' l='451'>/* Get/set state: malloc_get_state() records the current state of all
   malloc variables (_except_ for the actual heap contents and `hook&apos;
   function pointers) in a system dependent, opaque data structure.
   This data structure is dynamically allocated and can be free()d
   after use.  malloc_set_state() restores the state of all malloc
   variables to the previously obtained state.  This is especially
   useful when using this malloc as part of a shared library, and when
   the heap contents are saved/restored via some other method.  The
   primary example for this is GNU Emacs with its `dumping&apos; procedure.
   `Hook&apos; function pointers are never saved or restored by these
   functions, with two exceptions: If malloc checking was in use when
   malloc_get_state() was called, then malloc_set_state() calls
   __malloc_check_init() if possible; if malloc checking was not in
   use in the recorded state but the user requested malloc checking,
   then the hooks are reset to 0.  */</doc>
