 * FALLOC_FL_UNSHARE_RANGE is used to unshare shared blocks within the
 * file size without overwriting any existing data. The purpose of this
 * call is to preemptively reallocate any blocks that are subject to
 * copy-on-write.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
 * granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to filesystem
 * block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or smaller
 * depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the filesystem
 * or file.
 *
 * This flag can only be used with allocate-mode fallocate, which is
 * to say that it cannot be used with the punch, zero, collapse, or
 * insert range modes.
