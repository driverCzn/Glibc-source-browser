 * Get server side input from some transport.
 *
 * Statement of authentication parameters management:
 * This function owns and manages all authentication parameters, specifically
 * the &quot;raw&quot; parameters (msg.rm_call.cb_cred and msg.rm_call.cb_verf) and
 * the &quot;cooked&quot; credentials (rqst-&gt;rq_clntcred).
 * However, this function does not know the structure of the cooked
 * credentials, so it make the following assumptions:
 *   a) the structure is contiguous (no pointers), and
 *   b) the cred structure size does not exceed RQCRED_SIZE bytes.
 * In all events, all three parameters are freed upon exit from this routine.
 * The storage is trivially management on the call stack in user land, but
 * is mallocated in kernel land.
