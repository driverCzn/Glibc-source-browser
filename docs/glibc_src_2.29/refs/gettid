   returned value is not subject to caching.  Most Linux system calls
   accept a TID in place of a PID.  Using the TID to change properties
   of a thread that has been created using pthread_create can lead to
   undefined behavior (comparable to manipulating file descriptors
   directly that have not been created explicitly).  Note that a TID
   uniquely identifies a thread only while this thread is running; a
   TID can be reused once a thread has exited, even if the thread is
   not detached and has not been joined.  */</doc>
