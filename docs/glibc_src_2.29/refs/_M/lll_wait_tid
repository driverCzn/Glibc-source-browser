<doc f='glibc_src_2.29/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/lowlevellock.h' l='230'>/* The kernel notifies a process which uses CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID via futex
   wake-up when the clone terminates.  The memory location contains the
   thread ID while the clone is running and is reset to zero by the kernel
   afterwards.  The kernel up to version 3.16.3 does not use the private futex
   operations for futex wake-up when the clone terminates.
   If ABSTIME is not NULL, is used a timeout for futex call.  If the timeout
   occurs then return ETIMEOUT, if ABSTIME is invalid, return EINVAL.
   The futex operation are issues with cancellable versions.  */</doc>
