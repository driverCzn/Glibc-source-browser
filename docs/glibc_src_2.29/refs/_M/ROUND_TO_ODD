   EXPR; the union type in which to store the result is UNION and the
   subfield of the &quot;ieee&quot; field of that union with the low part of the
   mantissa is MANTISSA; SUFFIX is the suffix for the libc_fe* macros
   to ensure that the correct rounding mode is used, for platforms
   with multiple rounding modes where those macros set only the
   relevant mode.  This macro does not work correctly if the sign of
   an exact zero result depends on the rounding mode, so that case
   must be checked for separately.  */</doc>
