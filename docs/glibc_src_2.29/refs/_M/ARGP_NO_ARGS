<doc f='glibc_src_2.29/argp/argp.h' l='334'>/* Don&apos;t parse any non-option args.  Normally non-option args are parsed by
   calling the parse functions with a key of ARGP_KEY_ARG, and the actual arg
   as the value.  Since it&apos;s impossible to know which parse function wants to
   handle it, each one is called in turn, until one returns 0 or an error
   other than ARGP_ERR_UNKNOWN; if an argument is handled by no one, the
   argp_parse returns prematurely (but with a return value of 0).  If all
   args have been parsed without error, all parsing functions are called one
   last time with a key of ARGP_KEY_END.  This flag needn&apos;t normally be set,
   as the normal behavior is to stop parsing as soon as some argument can&apos;t
   be handled.  */</doc>
