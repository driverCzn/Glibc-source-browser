   PRINTF_LDBL_IS_DBL indicates whether long double values are to be
   handled as having the same format as double, in which case the flag
   should be set to one, or as another format, otherwise.

   PRINTF_FORTIFY, when set to one, indicates that fortification checks
   are to be performed in input parameters.  This is used by the
   __*printf_chk functions, which are used when _FORTIFY_SOURCE is
   defined to 1 or 2.  Otherwise, such checks are ignored.

   PRINTF_CHK indicates, to the internal function being called, that the
   call is originated from one of the __*printf_chk functions.  */</doc>
