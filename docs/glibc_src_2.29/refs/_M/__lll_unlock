<doc f='glibc_src_2.29/sysdeps/nptl/lowlevellock.h' l='149'>/* Unconditionally set FUTEX to 0 (not acquired), releasing the lock.  If FUTEX
   was &gt;1 (acquired, possibly with waiters), then wake any waiters.  The waiter
   that acquires the lock will set FUTEX to &gt;1.
   Evaluate PRIVATE before releasing the lock so that we do not violate the
   mutex destruction requirements.  Specifically, we need to ensure that
   another thread can destroy the mutex (and reuse its memory) once it
   acquires the lock and when there will be no further lock acquisitions;
   thus, we must not access the lock after releasing it, or those accesses
   could be concurrent with mutex destruction or reuse of the memory.  */</doc>
