   Note: It is important that we also remember the locations of the pointers
   in the current state information, and restore the locations of the pointers
   from the old state information.  This is done by multiplexing the pointer
   location into the zeroth word of the state information. Note that due
   to the order in which things are done, it is OK to call setstate with the
   same state as the current state
   Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure.  */</doc>
