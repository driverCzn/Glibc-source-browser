       *  @brief  Return grouping specification.
       *
       *  This function returns a string representing groupings for the
       *  integer part of a number.  Groupings indicate where thousands
       *  separators should be inserted in the integer part of a number.
       *
       *  Each char in the return string is interpret as an integer
       *  rather than a character.  These numbers represent the number
       *  of digits in a group.  The first char in the string
       *  represents the number of digits in the least significant
       *  group.  If a char is negative, it indicates an unlimited
       *  number of digits for the group.  If more chars from the
       *  string are required to group a number, the last char is used
       *  repeatedly.
       *
       *  For example, if the grouping() returns &quot;\003\002&quot; and is
       *  applied to the number 123456789, this corresponds to
       *  12,34,56,789.  Note that if the string was &quot;32&quot;, this would
       *  put more than 50 digits into the least significant group if
       *  the character set is ASCII.
       *
       *  The string is returned by calling
       *  numpunct&lt;char_type&gt;::do_grouping().
       *
       *  @return  string representing grouping specification.
