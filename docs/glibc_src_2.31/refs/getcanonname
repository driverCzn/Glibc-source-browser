   the service function did not provide it.  It tries to obtain the
   name using getcanonname_r from the same service NIP.  If the name
   cannot be canonicalized, return a copy of NAME.  Return NULL on
   memory allocation failure.  The returned string is allocated on the
   heap; the caller has to free it.  */</doc>
