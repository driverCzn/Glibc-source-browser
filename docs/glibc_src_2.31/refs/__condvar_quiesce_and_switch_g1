   leave G1, converts G1 into a fresh G2, and then switches group roles so that
   the former G2 becomes the new G1 ending at the current __wseq value when we
   eventually make the switch (WSEQ is just an observation of __wseq by the
   signaler).
   If G2 is empty, it will not switch groups because then it would create an
   empty G1 which would require switching groups again on the next signal.
   Returns false iff groups were not switched because G2 was empty.  */</doc>
