   PRINTF_LDBL_IS_DBL indicates whether long double values are to be
   handled as having the same format as double, in which case the flag
   should be set to one, or as another format, otherwise.

   PRINTF_FORTIFY, when set to one, indicates that fortification checks
   are to be performed in input parameters.  This is used by the
   __*printf_chk functions, which are used when _FORTIFY_SOURCE is
   defined to 1 or 2.  Otherwise, such checks are ignored.

   PRINTF_CHK indicates, to the internal function being called, that the
   call is originated from one of the __*printf_chk functions.

   PRINTF_LDBL_USES_FLOAT128 is used on platforms where the long double
   format used to be different from the IEC 60559 double format *and*
   also different from the Quadruple 128-bits IEC 60559 format (such as
   the IBM Extended Precision format on powerpc or the 80-bits IEC 60559
   format on x86), but was later converted to the Quadruple 128-bits IEC
   60559 format, which is the same format that the _Float128 always has
   (hence the `USES_FLOAT128&apos; suffix in the name of the flag).  When set
   to one, this macro indicates that long double values are to be
   handled as having this new format.  Otherwise, they should be handled
   as the previous format on that platform.  */</doc>
