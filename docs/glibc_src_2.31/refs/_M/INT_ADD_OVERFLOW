   The INT_&lt;op&gt;_OVERFLOW macros return 1 if the corresponding C operators
   might not yield numerically correct answers due to arithmetic overflow.
   The INT_&lt;op&gt;_WRAPV macros compute the low-order bits of the sum,
   difference, and product of two C integers, and return 1 if these
   low-order bits are not numerically correct.
   These macros work correctly on all known practical hosts, and do not rely
   on undefined behavior due to signed arithmetic overflow.

   Example usage, assuming A and B are long int:

     if (INT_MULTIPLY_OVERFLOW (a, b))
       printf (&quot;result would overflow\n&quot;);
     else
       printf (&quot;result is %ld (no overflow)\n&quot;, a * b);

   Example usage with WRAPV flavor:

     long int result;
     bool overflow = INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV (a, b, &amp;result);
     printf (&quot;result is %ld (%s)\n&quot;, result,
             overflow ? &quot;after overflow&quot; : &quot;no overflow&quot;);

   Restrictions on these macros:

   These macros do not check for all possible numerical problems or
   undefined or unspecified behavior: they do not check for division
   by zero, for bad shift counts, or for shifting negative numbers.

   These macros may evaluate their arguments zero or multiple times, so the
   arguments should not have side effects.

   The WRAPV macros are not constant expressions.  They support only
   +, binary -, and *.  Because the WRAPV macros convert the result,
   they report overflow in different circumstances than the OVERFLOW
   macros do.

   These macros are tuned for their last input argument being a constant.

   Return 1 if the integer expressions A * B, A - B, -A, A * B, A / B,
   A % B, and A &lt;&lt; B would overflow, respectively.  */</doc>
