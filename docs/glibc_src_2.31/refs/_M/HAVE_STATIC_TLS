<doc f='glibc_src_2.31/elf/dynamic-link.h' l='19'>/* This macro is used as a callback from elf_machine_rel{a,} when a
   static TLS reloc is about to be performed.  Since (in dl-load.c) we
   permit dynamic loading of objects that might use such relocs, we
   have to check whether each use is actually doable.  If the object
   whose TLS segment the reference resolves to was allocated space in
   the static TLS block at startup, then it&apos;s ok.  Otherwise, we make
   an attempt to allocate it in surplus space on the fly.  If that
   can&apos;t be done, we fall back to the error that DF_STATIC_TLS is
   intended to produce.  */</doc>
