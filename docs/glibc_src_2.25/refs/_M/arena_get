   First, try the one last locked successfully by this thread.  (This
   is the common case and handled with a macro for speed.)  Then, loop
   once over the circularly linked list of arenas.  If no arena is
   readily available, create a new one.  In this latter case, `size&apos;
   is just a hint as to how much memory will be required immediately
   in the new arena. */</doc>
