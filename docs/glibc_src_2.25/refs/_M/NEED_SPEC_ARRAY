   &lt;bits/environments.h&gt; (generally via &lt;unistd.h&gt;) and must have
   defined the following macros, exactly one of which will be called
   for each POSIX environment:

   KNOWN_PRESENT_ENVIRONMENT, for POSIX environments that are known to
   be supported in this libc.

   KNOWN_ABSENT_ENVIRONMENT, for POSIX environments that are known not
   to be supported on this system.

   UNKNOWN_ENVIRONMENT, for POSIX environments not supported in this
   libc but possibly supported by another libc on the same system,
   that can be selected using the same compiler but different
   compilation options.

   Each macro has arguments (SC_PREFIX, ENV_PREFIX, SUFFIX).  The
   corresponding argument to sysconf is _SC_##SC_PREFIX##_##SUFFIX.
   The environment name, as used with getconf, is
   ENV_PREFIX##_##SUFFIX, and the corresponding macro is the same with
   a leading &quot;_&quot;.

   In addition, the macros START_ENV_GROUP and END_ENV_GROUP must be
   defined.  These are called with arguments V5, V6, V7 before and
   after the relevant groups of environments.  */</doc>
