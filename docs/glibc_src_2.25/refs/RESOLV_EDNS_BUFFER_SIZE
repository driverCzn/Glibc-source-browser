<doc f='glibc_src_2.25/resolv/resolv-internal.h' l='37'>/* The advertized EDNS buffer size.  The value 1200 is derived
       from the IPv6 minimum MTU (1280 bytes) minus some arbitrary
       space for tunneling overhead.  If the DNS server does not react
       to ICMP Fragmentation Needed But DF Set messages, this should
       avoid all UDP fragments on current networks.  Avoiding UDP
       fragments is desirable because it prevents fragmentation-based
       spoofing attacks because the randomness in a DNS packet is
       concentrated in the first fragment (with the headers) and does
       not protect subsequent fragments.  */</doc>
