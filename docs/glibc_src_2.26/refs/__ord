   REQUIRE_ORDER means don&apos;t recognize them as options; stop option
   processing when the first non-option is seen.  This is what POSIX
   specifies should happen.

   PERMUTE means permute the contents of ARGV as we scan, so that
   eventually all the non-options are at the end.  This allows options
   to be given in any order, even with programs that were not written
   to expect this.

   RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were
   written to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order
   and that care about the ordering of the two.  We describe each
   non-option ARGV-element as if it were the argument of an option
   with character code 1.

   The special argument &apos;--&apos; forces an end of option-scanning regardless
   of the value of &apos;ordering&apos;.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only
   &apos;--&apos; can cause &apos;getopt&apos; to return -1 with &apos;optind&apos; != ARGC.  */</doc>
