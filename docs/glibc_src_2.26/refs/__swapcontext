  Saves the machine context in oucp such that when it is activated,
  it appears as if __swapcontextt() returned again, restores the
  machine context in ucp and thereby resumes execution in that
  context.

  This implementation is intended to be used for *synchronous* context
  switches only.  Therefore, it does not have to save anything
  other than the PRESERVED state.  */</doc>
