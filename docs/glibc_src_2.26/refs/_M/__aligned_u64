 * aligned_u64 should be used in defining kernel&lt;-&gt;userspace ABIs to avoid
 * common 32/64-bit compat problems.
 * 64-bit values align to 4-byte boundaries on x86_32 (and possibly other
 * architectures) and to 8-byte boundaries on 64-bit architectures.  The new
 * aligned_64 type enforces 8-byte alignment so that structs containing
 * aligned_64 values have the same alignment on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
 * No conversions are necessary between 32-bit user-space and a 64-bit kernel.
