<doc f='glibc_src_2.26/math/lgamma-compat.h' l='24'>/* XSI POSIX requires lgamma to set signgam, but ISO C does not permit
   this.  Namespace issues can be avoided if the functions set
   __signgam and signgam is a weak alias, but this only works if both
   signgam and __signgam were exported from the glibc version the
   program was linked against.  Before glibc 2.23, lgamma functions
   set signgam which was not a weak alias for __signgam, so old
   binaries have dynamic symbols for signgam only and the versions of
   lgamma used for old binaries must set both signgam and __signgam.
   Those versions also do a check of _LIB_VERSION != _ISOC_ to match
   old glibc.

   Users of this file define USE_AS_COMPAT to 0 when building the main
   version of lgamma, 1 when building the compatibility version.  */</doc>
