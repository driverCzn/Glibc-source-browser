 * Revision information.  This is the release date in YYYYMMDD format.
 * It can change every day so the right thing to do with it is use it
 * in preprocessor commands such as &quot;#if (__RES &gt; 19931104)&quot;.  Do not
 * compare for equality; rather, use it to determine whether your resolver
 * is new enough to contain a certain feature.
