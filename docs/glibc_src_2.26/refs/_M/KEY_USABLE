   the sequence counter would overflow after the next destroy call.
   This would mean that we potentially free memory for a key with the
   same sequence.  This is *very* unlikely to happen, A program would
   have to create and destroy a key 2^31 times (on 32-bit platforms,
   on 64-bit platforms that would be 2^63).  If it should happen we
   simply don&apos;t use this specific key anymore.  */</doc>
