   array member named MEMBER that is followed by N bytes of other data.
   This is not simply sizeof (TYPE) + N, since it may require
   alignment on unusually picky C11 platforms, and
   FLEXIBLE_ARRAY_MEMBER may be 1 on pre-C11 platforms.
   Yield a value less than N if and only if arithmetic overflow occurs.  */</doc>
