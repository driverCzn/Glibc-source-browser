   UWtype -- An unsigned type, default type for operations (typically a &quot;word&quot;)
   UHWtype -- An unsigned type, at least half the size of UWtype.
   UDWtype -- An unsigned type, at least twice as large a UWtype
   W_TYPE_SIZE -- size in bits of UWtype

   UQItype -- Unsigned 8 bit type.
   SItype, USItype -- Signed and unsigned 32 bit types.
   DItype, UDItype -- Signed and unsigned 64 bit types.

   On a 32 bit machine UWtype should typically be USItype;
   on a 64 bit machine, UWtype should typically be UDItype.  */</doc>
