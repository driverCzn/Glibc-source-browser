   Subtract 1 for the sign bit if T is signed, and then add 1 more for
   a minus sign if needed.

   Because _GL_SIGNED_TYPE_OR_EXPR sometimes returns 0 when its argument is
   signed, this macro may overestimate the true bound by one byte when
   applied to unsigned types of size 2, 4, 16, ... bytes.  */</doc>
