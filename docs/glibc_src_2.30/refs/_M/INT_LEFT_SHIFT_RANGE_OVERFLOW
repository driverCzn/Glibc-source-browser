   See above for restrictions.  Here, MIN and MAX are for A only, and B need
   not be of the same type as the other arguments.  The C standard says that
   behavior is undefined for shifts unless 0 &lt;= B &lt; wordwidth, and that when
   A is negative then A &lt;&lt; B has undefined behavior and A &gt;&gt; B has
   implementation-defined behavior, but do not check these other
   restrictions.  */</doc>
