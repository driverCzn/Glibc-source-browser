   If not set, and debugging was on, turn it off.
   This only works if regex.c is compiled -DDEBUG.
   We define this bit always, so that all that&apos;s needed to turn on
   debugging is to recompile regex.c; the calling code can always have
   this bit set, and it won&apos;t affect anything in the normal case. */</doc>
