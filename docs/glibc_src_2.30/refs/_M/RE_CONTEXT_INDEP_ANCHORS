<doc f='glibc_src_2.30/posix/regex.h' l='90'>/* If this bit is set, then ^ and $ are always anchors (outside bracket
     expressions, of course).
   If this bit is not set, then it depends:
	^  is an anchor if it is at the beginning of a regular
	   expression or after an open-group or an alternation operator;
	$  is an anchor if it is at the end of a regular expression, or
	   before a close-group or an alternation operator.

   This bit could be (re)combined with RE_CONTEXT_INDEP_OPS, because
   POSIX draft 11.2 says that * etc. in leading positions is undefined.
   We already implemented a previous draft which made those constructs
   invalid, though, so we haven&apos;t changed the code back.  */</doc>
