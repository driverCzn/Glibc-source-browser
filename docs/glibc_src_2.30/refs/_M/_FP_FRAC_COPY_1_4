   complicated than I&apos;d have expected it to be, so these might be
   wrong... These macros are in any case somewhat bogus because they
   use information about what various FRAC_n variables look like
   internally [eg, that 2 word vars are X_f0 and x_f1]. But so do
   the ones in op-2.h and op-1.h.  */</doc>
