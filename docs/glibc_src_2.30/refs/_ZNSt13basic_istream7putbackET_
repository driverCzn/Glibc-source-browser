       *  If @c rdbuf() is not null, calls @c rdbuf()-&gt;sputbackc(c).

       *  If @c rdbuf() is null or if @c sputbackc() fails, sets badbit in
       *  the error state.

       *  @note  This function first clears eofbit.  Since no characters
       *         are extracted, the next call to @c gcount() will return 0,
