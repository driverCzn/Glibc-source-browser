   incremented on each failure.  The failed member is set to true if a
   failure is detected, so that even if the counter wraps around to
   zero, the failure of a test can be detected.

   The init constructor function below puts *state on a shared
   annonymous mapping, so that failure reports from subprocesses
   propagate to the parent process.  */</doc>
