   The local user is LOCUSER, on the remote machine the command is

   connection is returned.  The caller must have the right to use a
   reserved port.  When the function returns *AHOST contains the
   official host name.

   This function is not part of POSIX and therefore no official

   or due to the implementation it is a cancellation point and
   therefore not marked with __THROW.  */</doc>
