 * FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE is used to remove a range of a file
 * without leaving a hole in the file. The contents of the file beyond
 * the range being removed is appended to the start offset of the range
 * being removed (i.e. the hole that was punched is &quot;collapsed&quot;),
 * resulting in a file layout that looks like the range that was
 * removed never existed. As such collapsing a range of a file changes
 * the size of the file, reducing it by the same length of the range
 * that has been removed by the operation.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
 * granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to
 * filesystem block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or
 * smaller depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the
 * filesystem or file.
 *
 * Attempting to collapse a range that crosses the end of the file is
 * considered an illegal operation - just use ftruncate(2) if you need
 * to collapse a range that crosses EOF.
