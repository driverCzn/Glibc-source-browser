<doc f='glibc_src_2.28/soft-fp/op-2.h' l='429'>/* Do at most 120x120=240 bits multiplication using double floating
   point multiplication.  This is useful if floating point
   multiplication has much bigger throughput than integer multiply.
   It is supposed to work for _FP_W_TYPE_SIZE 64 and wfracbits
   between 106 and 120 only.
   Caller guarantees that X and Y has (1LLL &lt;&lt; (wfracbits - 1)) set.
   SETFETZ is a macro which will disable all FPU exceptions and set rounding
   towards zero,  RESETFE should optionally reset it back.  */</doc>
